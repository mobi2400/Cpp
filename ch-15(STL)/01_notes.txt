TYPES OF DATA STRUCTURE
1. Array- it can be declare by two TYPES
          stack int A[10]-- here memory is fixed
          heap  *A = new int[10]-- it is dynamic memory allocation storage size can be increased

2. linked list - kind of chain structure data where new data can be added anytime same as adding chain
addition can be done forward and backward too

MORE TYPE OF DATA STRUCTURE ON THE BASIS OF MODIFICATION
    stack
    que deque
    priority-que
    map
    set

STL -- collection of many header file or library which are inbuild to perform many data structure operations
  it compromise-
                algorithm
                containers
                iterators

            TYPES OF algorithm U CAN perform
                search() 
                sort()
                binary_search()
                reverse()
                concat()
                copy()
                union()
                intersection()
                merge()
                heap()
            TYPES OF containers available
                vector -- push_back()
                       -- pop_back()
                       -- insert()
                       -- remove()
                       -- size()
                       -- empty()

                list -- push_front()
                     -- pop_front()
                     -- back()
                     -- REST ALL SAME AS vector

                forward_list -- SAME FUNCTION AS list

                deque -- SAME AS vector BUT FUNCTION IS SAME AS list
                   
                priority_queue
                stack - LIFO(last in first out)
                set - containonly unique DATA
                multiset -- allow duplicate DATA
                map -- store <key;value> pair
                multiMap -- duplicate keys are allowed but value    should be  different
