 1. Intro: Why C++? (And Why We're All Slightly Mad) 🤪

C++: it's fast, it's powerful, and it's… well, C++. This repo is your survival guide to navigating its quirks and mastering its might. We're here to learn, laugh, and maybe cry a little. 😭😂

2. Compiling: Turn Coffee into Code (Or Something Like That) ☕➡️💻

To turn your beautiful (or hilariously broken) C++ code into something your computer understands, you'll need a compiler, like g++.
